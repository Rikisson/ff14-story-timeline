# Styling rules

Tailwind v4 is the styling layer. Components reference semantic tokens defined in `src/styles.css` rather than raw palette utilities. Themes are switched by toggling a class on `<html>`, which redefines the token CSS variables.

# Rules

## Absolute rule: every system color is a token

**All system-provided color in the codebase flows through a token in
`src/styles.css`.** No raw Tailwind palette utilities (`bg-white`,
`text-slate-700`, `from-indigo-200`, `bg-amber-50/40`, …), no inline hex
literals, no `rgb(…)` / `rgba(…)` calls, no `dark:` siblings. If a
component needs a color, the right token already exists or you add one.

The single exception is **user-issued color stored in user data** —
values the end user typed (e.g., the color picker for a plotline or a
codex category). Those flow through `[style.color]` / `[style.background]`
bindings with a token-based fallback for the null case
(`p.color ?? 'var(--color-foreground-subtle)'`). Default values in seed
data and form pickers are user-facing palette choices, not design-system
chrome — those stay raw too.

Themes adapt by redefining the token values, not by adding utilities to
components. Adding a new theme is a single new selector block in
`styles.css`; no component needs to change.

## Token system

All tokens live in `src/styles.css`. Tailwind v4 generates utilities from
each token (`--color-foo` → `bg-foo`, `text-foo`, `border-foo`,
`ring-foo`, `from-foo`, `to-foo`, etc.).

The light `@theme` and dark `.dark` blocks are kept structurally
identical: every token defined in one is defined in the other, in the
same order, with the same group comments. When adding a token, add it to
both blocks at the same index so the file reads as two parallel columns.
A token that only makes sense in one theme is a smell — pick a value for
the other theme too, even if it's the same hex.

The token vocabulary:

- **Surfaces** — `canvas` (page bg), `surface` (cards/panels/dialogs),
  `surface-muted` (hover/badge), `surface-strong` (deeper hover),
  `surface-stronger` (active/pressed), `surface-subtle` (lightest hover).
- **Text** — `foreground` (primary), `foreground-muted` (body),
  `foreground-subtle` (labels), `foreground-faint` (hints/placeholders).
- **Borders** — `border` (panel borders), `border-strong` (input borders).
- **Roles** — `warning`, `danger`, `success` each expose a soft surface
  family: `{role}` (soft tinted bg), `{role}-foreground` (text/icon),
  `{role}-border` (border). `danger` additionally has a strong button
  family for destructive actions, mirroring `accent`: `danger-strong`
  (also the validation outline color), `danger-strong-hover`,
  `danger-strong-active`, `danger-strong-foreground`, `danger-strong-ring`.
- **Accent** — `accent` (button/strong), `accent-hover`, `accent-active`,
  `accent-foreground` (text on accent), `accent-ring` (focus ring),
  `accent-soft` (selection bg), `accent-soft-foreground`.
- **Special** — `overlay` (loading scrim over the page), `backdrop`
  (dialog backdrop), `workspace` (node-editor canvas; sits one step
  below `surface` in both themes), `scrim` + `scrim-foreground` (image
  scrim — the dark veneer over user-uploaded covers and the always-light
  text/UI that sits on top; applied with opacity modifiers like
  `bg-scrim/40` and `text-scrim-foreground/90`).
- **Tone palette** — identity hues for entity-kind chips, app-tag tones,
  and decorative section handles. Six tones (`tone-indigo`,
  `tone-emerald`, `tone-amber`, `tone-fuchsia`, `tone-sky`, `tone-rose`)
  each expose five facets:
  - `{tone}` — medium bg (tags, calendar handles, picker hover)
  - `{tone}-soft` — soft bg (kind UI chip, picker default, inline ref hover)
  - `{tone}-foreground` — readable text on either bg
  - `{tone}-foreground-strong` — emphasized text (picker)
  - `{tone}-border` — outline (picker)
  Slate-toned identity (codexEntry kind, neutral tag) reuses the
  surface/foreground/border tokens above instead of a dedicated tone.

## How to write components

Reach for the token family that names the role, never the palette. Form inputs always carry `border-border-strong`; role surfaces (`warning` / `danger` / `success`) use the matching `{role}` / `{role}-foreground` / `{role}-border` triplet; accent selection vs. accent button is the soft/strong split (`bg-accent-soft` vs. `bg-accent`); image scrims pair `bg-scrim/N` with `text-scrim-foreground`. For class bindings, write one binding per token (`[class.bg-accent-soft]="selected()"`) — never pair a light utility with a `dark:` sibling.

Two examples covering the awkward cases:

```html
<input class="border-border-strong bg-surface text-foreground placeholder:text-foreground-faint focus:ring-accent-ring focus:border-accent">

<button uiDanger>…</button>  <!-- prefer the directive over hand-rolling bg-danger-strong/hover/active/ring -->
```

## Button hierarchy

Four variants live in `shared/ui/button/`. Pick the one that matches the
button's role on the screen, not the noun on its label — "Add" can be
primary or secondary depending on what else is on the page.

- `uiPrimary` (filled accent) — the page's dominant action. The Add CTA
  on a list page (events, stories, characters), Save on a form or
  settings panel, Restart on the end screen. At most one Primary
  visible per region.
- `uiSecondary` (filled `surface-muted`) — a meaningful secondary action
  living next to a Primary, or a chrome-level action with no Primary
  competition. Add scene next to Save in the editor header, Add era /
  Add category next to Save in settings, Replace asset next to Remove,
  Sign in in the app header, Start over in the auto-resume reader
  aside.
- `uiGhost` (transparent) — tertiary, low-emphasis controls. Cancel in
  form footers, Reset, Edit on a card (paired with Delete), Remove for
  asset clearing (paired with Replace), View more pagination, header
  utilities like Copy UID / Sign out, catalog filter Reset.
- `uiDanger` (filled `danger-strong`) — destructive, irreversible
  actions. Delete on entity cards, Remove era / season / sprite /
  category / member, scene Delete in the editor.

All four directives match both `<button>` and `<a>` host elements. On
buttons the disabled input maps to the native `disabled` attribute; on
anchors it maps to `aria-disabled="true"` plus `tabindex="-1"`. The
custom Tailwind variant `inactive:` (defined in `styles.css`) targets
both forms, so disabled styling — `bg-surface-muted text-foreground-faint
border-border`, applied in the base directive — reads consistently
regardless of element or variant. Don't add per-button disabled
overrides.

A page that needs a heroically large button (oversized CTA over a hero
image, e.g. catalog story detail) should keep its classes inline rather
than fight the directive with overrides; introducing a size variant is
warranted only once two pages share the need.

## Identity colors flow through the tone palette

Lookup files map identity strings to tone-token utility classes — they
contain no raw colors, only token references:

- `shared/utils/entity-kind-palette.ts` — entity kind chip / picker /
  inline-text ref classes per `EntityKind`. Character→indigo,
  place→emerald, event→amber, story→fuchsia, plotline→sky. CodexEntry
  uses the neutral surface/foreground tokens directly.
- `shared/ui/tag/tag.component.ts` — `TagTone` ('neutral' | 'amber' |
  'emerald' | 'sky' | 'indigo' | 'rose') maps to `bg-tone-{tone}
  text-tone-{tone}-foreground`. Neutral uses `bg-surface-muted
  text-foreground-muted`.
- `features/calendar/feature/calendar-settings-panel.component.ts` —
  decorative section handles use `bg-tone-{indigo|emerald|amber}` plus
  the `-foreground` pair.

A new theme retunes identity by redefining the tone tokens in its
selector block. No component code changes.

## Brand

The Opovid wordmark is the one piece of identity that lives outside the
token families. `<app-brand>` (`shared/ui/brand/`) renders the name in
`--font-brand` — self-hosted Cormorant, two subset files for Latin
("Opovid") and Ukrainian Cyrillic («Оповідь») — and follows
`LocaleService` so it reads natively in either language. The opening
letter is rubricated in `--color-brand-rubric`, a true theme token: a
deep garnet in light, lightened to a rose-garnet in dark so it keeps
WCAG AA on the dark canvas. That colour appears only in the wordmark,
the favicon and the landing flourish — never UI chrome — so it never
collides with the `danger` role. The book mark beside the name reuses
`--color-accent` and needs no token of its own.

## Reader

The reader carries a small layout vocabulary in `src/styles.css` that
keeps presentation knobs out of component code:

- `--reader-card-width` / `--reader-page-width` — widths of the two
  reader text panels: the story reader's floating card (default `60%`)
  and the event reader's centered reading page (default `42rem`).
  Override either at any scope to retune the layout without touching
  templates.
- `.reader-font-{small|medium|large|xl}` — applied to the reader root
  by `ReaderPreferencesService.fontSize`. Each class sets
  `--scene-font-size`, which the typewriter and floating card read.
- `.reader-bg-effect-{darken|desaturate|sepia|cool|warm}` — mood
  filters applied to the background layer when
  `Scene.backgroundEffect` is set. The filter sits on the layer
  container only; character sprites stay full-saturation.
- `.reader-card` — the reader text panel. Opaque `bg-surface`,
  `border-border`, soft shadow, `font-size: var(--scene-font-size)`.
  The story reader uses the default floating card,
  absolute-positioned at `bottom: 6%` of the article. The event
  reader adds `.reader-card-page`: vertically centered, narrower
  (`--reader-page-width`), capped at `78vh` with internal scroll so a
  long lore entry stays inside the panel.

Idle-fade chrome and the OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` collapse
are driven by component-local signals, not CSS variables, so they
don't appear in the styling layer.

## Theme switching

- `ThemeService` (`shared/services/theme.service.ts`) holds the user's `'light' | 'dark' | 'system'` preference, persists it to `localStorage`, and toggles `.dark` on `<html>` via an effect.
- A pre-hydration script in `src/index.html` reads `localStorage.theme` and applies the class before Angular renders, so dark loads don't flash light.
- The toggle UI is `<app-theme-toggle>` in `shared/ui/theme-toggle/`. It cycles System → Light → Dark.
- The token block in `styles.css` is the single source of theme values. To add a third theme, add a new selector block (e.g. `.warm { ... }`) redefining the same variable names; component templates need no changes.

## Editor and Rete

- The editor surfaces (`features/editor/feature/editor.page.ts`, `features/editor/ui/scene-editor-panel.component.ts`, `features/editor/ui/story-meta-panel.component.ts`, `features/editor/ui/rete-canvas.component.ts`) style via CSS-in-styles blocks rather than utilities. Rules inside those blocks reference global tokens directly: `background: var(--color-surface); color: var(--color-foreground)`. No per-component `:host-context(.dark)` overrides — the global block does the work.
- The Rete plugin renders nodes/connections through component-encapsulated styles with build-hashed selectors (`[_nghost-XXX]`) that can't be reached from component CSS. Override Rete from `src/styles.css` using its stable host hooks: `[data-testid='node']` for the node container, `connection svg path` for connection lines, and `[data-testid='input-socket'] > *` / `[data-testid='output-socket'] > *` for the socket discs. These overrides reference tokens too, so they follow the active theme.

## Accessibility and contrast

- Tokens are tuned to maintain WCAG AA contrast in both light and dark. Don't substitute lower-contrast shades when adding a new theme.
- Form inputs always have a visible border (`border-border-strong`) — never rely on bg alone to delineate them.
- Focus rings always render against the canvas color via `focus-visible:ring-offset-canvas` (set in the button base). When adding new focus-able surfaces, keep this offset.
